<br/>

As it can be seen from the image, that some prob are not linearly solvable. In order to fix this a classic example is of XORing two features.

The above is a good example of how a XOR works provided that activation is ReLu.

- Because the above problem is segregated through a circle it needs a polynomial x2+y2 to solve this therefore two neuron


- If problem is too ❗❗❗ add hidden layers


- Universal Approximation Theorem suggest that any problem can be solved if we know the correct number of neurons
